# ZEP Extension Implementation Guide

## ✅ Completed: Task 1 - Project Setup and Build Configuration

### What's Been Done:
- ✅ Created `package.json` with all required dependencies for Azure DevOps extension development
- ✅ Configured TypeScript with `tsconfig.json`
- ✅ Set up Webpack build system with `webpack.config.js`
- ✅ Added ESLint configuration for code quality
- ✅ Created proper `.gitignore` for Node.js/TypeScript projects
- ✅ Created directory structure: `src/{workitem-group,services,types,settings}` and `images/`
- ✅ Updated task definitions with correct field names from your API:
  - ZEP tickets field: `Custom.ZEPNummer`
  - Duration field: `CUSTOM.IST`

## 🔧 Manual Steps Required

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run in PowerShell from project root:
```powershell
npm install
```

### 2. Create Extension Publisher Account
1. Go to [Azure DevOps Marketplace Publisher Management](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
2. Sign in with your Azure DevOps account
3. Create a new publisher account if you don't have one
4. Note your publisher ID for the extension manifest

### 3. Generate Personal Access Token
1. Go to Azure DevOps → User Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Create new token with **Full access** or **Marketplace (publish)** scope
3. Save token securely - you'll need it for publishing

### 4. ZEP API Configuration
You mentioned you'll provide the ZEP API details later. When ready, you'll need:
- ZEP API base URL
- ZEP API Bearer token
- ZEP API documentation for the endpoints we'll use

### 5. Verify Build System
Test the build configuration:
```powershell
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Development build
npm run build:dev

# Production build  
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch
```

## 📋 Next Tasks in Order

Based on dependencies, here's the recommended order:

### Task 2: Extension Manifest Configuration (High Priority)
- Create `vss-extension.json` with your publisher ID
- Configure permissions and contributions
- **Depends on**: Having publisher account

### Task 3: TypeScript Type Definitions (Medium Priority)  
- Define interfaces for ZEP API responses
- Create type definitions for work item integration
- **Can start immediately**

### Tasks 4-6: Core Services (High Priority)
- ZEP API Service (Task 4)
- Azure DevOps Work Item Service (Task 5)  
- Credential Management Service (Task 6)
- **Depends on**: Task 3 (types), ZEP API details

## 🔑 Key Information from Your API Calls

From `api_calls.md`, I've updated the implementation to use:

### Azure DevOps Fields:
- **ZEP Tickets Field**: `Custom.ZEPNummer` 
  - Contains: `"8136, 8403"` (comma-separated ZEP ticket IDs)
- **Duration Field**: `CUSTOM.IST`
  - Will be updated with calculated total hours

### Your Current API Setup:
- **Azure DevOps Org**: `GOpus/GOpus%20GmbH`
- **Work Item ID**: `80` (for testing)
- **Authentication**: Basic Auth (you have the token)

## 🚀 Ready to Continue

**Task 1 is complete!** 

To continue with the next task:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Create publisher account and get publisher ID
3. Run: `task-master show 2` to see Task 2 details
4. Or jump to Task 3 (Type Definitions) if you want to continue coding while setting up publisher account
